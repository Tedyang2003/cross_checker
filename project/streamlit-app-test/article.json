  "content": "A fire broke out late Monday night at the Dryden Textiles facility on the east end of the industrial district. Witnesses reported seeing smoke as early as 11:40 p.m., with flames visible from the adjacent highway by midnight. Fire crews from three neighboring towns responded. They contained the blaze after five hours. No fatalities were reported, but two workers remain hospitalized with smoke inhalation.\n\nOver 120 employees arrived Tuesday morning to find the building sealed off. Many had not yet been informed about the fire and waited behind barricades until police cleared the area. Management issued a brief statement through local media, confirming that operations would be suspended indefinitely. The company did not respond to requests for further comment.\n\nDryden Textiles, a manufacturer of synthetic fabric for commercial use, has operated in the area since 1972. The facility has been cited twice in the past five years for safety violations, including an unresolved citation related to faulty electrical systems.\n\nCity inspectors began preliminary assessments early Tuesday. Officials declined to speculate on the cause, but fire chief Daniel Mora stated that investigators found signs of an electrical short in the northwest corner of the facility.\n\nTemporary unemployment filings surged at the local labor office, with several workers citing the plant shutdown as the reason. ‘I’ve worked there twenty-one years. They didn’t even call us,’ said Luis Romero, a shift supervisor. ‘We saw it on the news.’"
